=head1 NAME

CInet::Alien::GANAK - The probabilistic model counter GANAK

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IPC::Run3;
    use CInet::Alien::GANAK qw(ganak);

    # Run #SAT solver on a DIMACS CNF file
    run3 [ganak, $cnf_file], \undef, \my $out, \undef;

    # Clauses produced programmatically can be sent to stdin
    run3 [ganak], \&produce_clauses, \my $out, \undef;

    # In any case, parse the answer from $out.
    # CAUTION: it may overflow Perl's native integer,
    # consider C<use bignum>.
    my ($count,) = $out =~ /^s mc (\d+)/;

=head2 VERSION

This document describes CInet::Alien::GANAK v1.0.0.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module builds a custom version of the probabilistic exact model
counter GANAK developed by Meel and collaborators. It takes a Boolean
formula in conjunctive normal form (in the DIMACS CNF format) and
produces the I<number> of satisfying assignments to it. It is correct
with a certain, adjustable probability. It may fail to terminate with
a conclusive answer as well.

The package C<CInet::Alien::GANAK> is an L<Alien::Base> with one
additional method:

=head2 exe

    my $program = CInet::Alien::GANAK->exe;

Returns the absolute path of the C<ganak> executable bundled with
this module.

=head1 EXPORTS

There is one optional export:

=head2 ganak

    use CInet::Alien::GANAK qw(ganak);
    my $program = ganak;

Returns the same path as C<exe> but is shorter to type.
